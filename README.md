# Citation-to-PDF-Generator

This is a project I started of my own accord to save my company $2000 in manual data collection. The goal was to compile a list of PDFs that the company had already used to make research posts on their site for the purposes of training a machine learning algorithm. Since the company did not have a saved record of these PDFs, my boss had initially planned to hire a third party to manually search for links to PDFs given their citations (that were listed under each company post).

I asked my boss if I could attempt to automate the search using Python notebooks and NLP libraries. He agreed. The code I produced took about a week to write, and ultimately returned a list of 1450 Table-Citation pairs. I saved the company almost a month of its time and $2000 of its budget for the project.
